              Hello guys! My name is Harman, welcome to my life! In this website I will be sharing my life. Im currently a senior at Guilford College, My major is Biology with an intergraded science minor. My goal is to go to physical therapy school and become a physical therapist. Some of my favorite things to do when I’m not doing school assignments is playing video games , playing volleyball, and hanging out with family or friends.  I have a younger brother, we are bestfriends, we mostly talk about basketball or video games.

          </p>

          <p>I wanted to make this website to share the hardships I went through in life and also to share what keeps me going. I want people to know they aren’t alone in life and things happen in life that can’t be controlled.</p>

          <p>So here’s my story:

I was born in Albany, NY, My parents were born in India in a state called Punjab, it is located in the northern part of India. I am bilingual I speak Punjabi and of course English. 

Growing up in America as an Indian girl has its ups and downs. Elementary school was hard for me I was bullied because I didn’t know English at that time and because of who I was. Middle school was okay too I had English down but there were some words I couldn’t pronounce. As high school came around I was pretty involved, I made friends and people were actually interested in my culture.  People use to ask me how come I didn’t have an Indian accent, haha I was like trust me I did I went through a whole process, ESL (English as a second language) this program helped me with my English. </p>
          <p>In 2013, My sophomore year in High school, my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. This was devastating because my mom is the person I go to everything and she’s my best-friend, I didn’t know what to do as a 15 year old. I remember coming home everyday from school and not seeing her because she was always at the hospital. I knew I had to grow up quickly and help around the house and help my brother with the knowledge I knew. 

My mom fought her battle like the strong woman she is, her strength inspires me everyday and keeps me going.</p>
          <p>In 2016, I graduated from high school and moved to North Carolina with my dad pursued my college. My brother and my mom were still back in NY, my brother had to finish his college and my mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer again and was doing her chemotherapy there. I did have moments when I was like why am I not with her?, I want to be there to help her. But the way my mom is she didn’t want me to be there she wanted me to focus in college and pursue my dream. </p>

          <p>The biggest regret in my life is not having enough time with the person you love the most. In 2019 I lost my mom to ovarian cancer. This was probably the most difficult time in my life. But I grew to be strong like her and I kept the things she to keep close. She inspired me to continue my education no matter what and to fulfill my dreams. She told me she will always be there for me no matter what.</p>

  <p>So guys, be grateful of what you have in life and just keep going through the obstacles, you guys will get there!!!!</p>
